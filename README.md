# Espresso preparation tools for 53mm portafilters

During the pandemic we ordered a <a href="https://clivecoffee.com/products/lucca-a53-mini-espresso-machine-by-la-spaziale">LUCCA A53 Mini</a> espresso machine which is produced by <a href="https://www.laspaziale.com/">La Spaziale</a> and has a 53mm portafilter which is smaller and deeper than a more traditional 58mm size.

The only equipment I had was for a 58mm and not nearby so I designed and printed a common base with screw in attachments.

Lets face it sometimes these projects are there so we can learn more complicate construction, in whatever design tools we use. For me, this is that.

Would I recommend it? If you have the cash I recommend <a href="https://stanthonyind.com/products/bloc-party?variant=39642722861221">St. Anthony Industries</a>. They make beautiful tools.
